# Audio2Hero: AI Charting Assistant

#### Audio2Hero is a charting assistant tool that produces chart templates that are actually on-beat! Unlike other autocharters, we use transformers âš¡ instead of predefined algorithms, so the rhythm and button selections are generated in the style of your specific song. You can use the result out of the box, or use it as a starting point to make your own custom charts faster ðŸŽ¶ !
